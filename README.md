# minecraft mod & plugin updater

this is my rugged and flexible solution to automate updating minecraft mods and server plugins across different sources because there is somehow no better alternative

im pretty sure this wont work on windows natively as it is now since it uses wget but idk i havent tested it

u r free 2 pull request if u so desire to add compatability to more sources or whatever yea

## todo
- start on management module as an alternative to direct file editing 
- start on setup module
